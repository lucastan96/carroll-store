# carroll-store
Carroll-Store is a shopping management system for staff to manage their shopping customers and orders. JDBC, proper database normalization, and a lot of features was used to create this system. Main functionalities include displaying products (all/by product ID/by category/by keyword), managing products, displaying orders (all/by customer ID), managing orders, and also managing customer records as well.

This was a 5 people group project for our second year Database Systems module, including myself, Yuan Jin Lim, Zhengxing Li, Alvin Khai Ming Teo, and Cheng Bin Lim.
